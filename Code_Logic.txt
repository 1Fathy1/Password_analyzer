8. Password Analyzer Tool 

Checks password strength using entropy.

Entropy password formal : E = L log2(R) 
                              L = length of password
                              R = Total character Range

    [    Total character Range ] 
    ----------------------------
      number       |     10
      lowercase    |     26
      uppercase    |     26
      symbols      |     32 
    
Logic code : 
    - First calculate character range 
    - calculate a bit of entropy : E = L log2(R) 
    - Power of password
    - suggest strong password 
    - make strong password 
        . at last one number
        . at last one lowercase
        . at last one uppercase
        . at last one symbol
    ## output . 
        - value of bit of entropy 
        - power of password 
        - suggest strong password 
        - Hacker need to try 2 ^ E to crack your password 
        - NIST Bad Passwords result
    - transaction with file
    - make a report
